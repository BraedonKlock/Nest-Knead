Nest & Knead is a work in progress project for a local farm. index.html (home page) is styled for mobile devices. Going to use @media to make it responsive to destop devices.
The other web pages are styled for laptops but stil need to be cleaned up in both the HTML and CSS files.
Im also going to add "add to cart" page that will add the total of products added to cart and give that value to the client. I'm going to use JavaScript for the script language.
