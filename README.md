Nest & Knead is a work in progress project for a local farm. index.html (home page) is styled for desktop and mobile devices. The mobile styling needs some work to make it more responsive.
The other web pages are styled for laptops but i need to make them more responsive. HTML files need comments
Im also going to add "add to cart" page that will add the total of products added to cart and give that value to the client. I'm going to use JavaScript for the script language.
