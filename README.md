Nest & Knead is a work in progress project for a local farm.

index.html (home page) is responsive and is styled for desktop and mobile devices.

The other web pages desktop style is complete. i have half the mobile style done for those pages, i'm just working on the <body>.

I plan on creating a tablet style too for all web pages.

HTML and CSS files need comments.

Product can be both added and removed from the cart using local storage. The cart page displays the total amount owed with an etransfer email for payment as the farm doesn't accept debit or credit at this time.
